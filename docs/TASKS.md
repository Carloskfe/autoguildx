---

## Sprint 3 — Social Graph ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Complete the follow graph loop and add comments so the feed becomes a real social experience.

### Backend
- [x] `GET /feed` — scope to followed users (join on `profile_followers`); falls back to all posts if following nobody
- [x] `CommentEntity` + `POST /posts/:id/comments` + `GET /posts/:id/comments`
- [x] `GET /profiles/me/following` — returns profiles the current user follows
- [x] `ProfilesService.getFollowingUserIds()` — used internally for feed scoping
- [x] `OptionalJwtAuthGuard` on `GET /feed` — feed is scoped when authenticated, public otherwise
- [x] Feed response includes `user.profile` relation so frontend can link to `/profile/[id]`

### Frontend
- [x] `/profile/[id]` — other users' profiles (name, bio, tags, follower count, posts)
- [x] Follow / unfollow button on other users' profiles (invalidates following cache)
- [x] Comment thread on feed posts (expand/collapse, load comments, add comment)
- [x] Feed `commentsCount` badge on each post card
- [x] Post author names link to `/profile/[id]` on the feed

### Tests
- [x] `posts/comments.service.spec.ts` — create, findByPost, error cases (83 total tests passing)

---

## Sprint 4 — Monetization ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Close the subscription loop — users can see their tier, upgrade, and the limits are enforced.

### Backend
- [x] Enforce listing limit per subscription tier in `ListingsService.create()` — throws 403 with message
- [x] Enforce featured campaign limit per tier in `ListingsService.featureListing()` — ownership check + tier check
- [x] `featureListing` now requires `userId` for ownership verification before boosting

### Frontend
- [x] `UpgradeModal` component — tier cards with pricing, features, upgrade button (`POST /subscriptions/upgrade`)
- [x] AppShell — subscription tier badge (Free / Owner / Company) in header + sidebar; click to open UpgradeModal
- [x] Featured listing boost CTA on `/marketplace/[id]` — shown for own non-featured listings; opens UpgradeModal on 403
- [x] `/marketplace/new` — 403 response from listing limit opens UpgradeModal automatically

### Tests
- [x] Updated `listings.service.spec.ts` — tier limit enforcement for create and featureListing (90 total tests passing)

---

## Sprint 5 — Media Uploads

**Goal:** Posts and listings can have real images; profiles have a photo.

### Backend
- [x] `UploadService` stub in `apps/api/src/upload/` — returns mock `uploadUrl` + `publicUrl` + `key`; swap body for real S3 SDK when credentials are ready
- [x] `POST /upload/presign` — returns a pre-signed URL for direct browser upload (stubbed)
- [x] Profile image upload endpoint (`PATCH /profiles/me` accepts `profileImageUrl`)
- [x] Accept `mediaUrls[]` on post and listing create (already in schema, just needs wiring)

### Frontend
- [x] `apps/web/src/lib/upload.ts` — shared `uploadFile(file)` helper: presign → PUT → return publicUrl
- [x] Profile image upload — camera overlay on avatar, file picker → upload → PATCH profileImageUrl
- [x] Post create form — Photo button, preview thumbnail, submit with mediaUrls
- [x] Feed post cards — render mediaUrls[0] image below content
- [x] Listing create form — up to 5 images with preview grid, submit with mediaUrls
- [x] Listing detail page — image gallery (single full-width or 2-col grid)

---

## Sprint 6 — Quality & Production Readiness

**Goal:** Test coverage, safe database schema management, and deployable to real infrastructure.

### Test infrastructure setup
- [x] Update `apps/api/jest.config.js` — change `rootDir` from `'src'` to `'.'` and set `testMatch` to `['<rootDir>/tests/unit/**/*.spec.ts']` (required so Jest discovers the mirrored `tests/unit/` directory)
- [x] Remove `--passWithNoTests` flag from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` once the unit test suite is established

### Unit tests — all under `apps/api/tests/unit/`, mirroring `apps/api/src/`
- [x] `auth/auth.service.spec.ts` — signup, login, Firebase token exchange, JWT issuance
- [x] `profiles/profiles.service.spec.ts` — create, update, follow/unfollow graph
- [x] `posts/posts.service.spec.ts` — create, like, delete, feed pagination
- [x] `listings/listings.service.spec.ts` — create, update, delete, filter, featured boost, tier limit enforcement
- [x] `events/events.service.spec.ts` — create, update, delete, RSVP
- [x] `subscriptions/subscriptions.service.spec.ts` — tier lookup, upgrade
- [x] `search/search.service.spec.ts` — cross-entity ILike search results

### E2E tests
- [x] Full auth flow — signup → onboarding → feed (`apps/api/test/auth.e2e-spec.ts`)
- [x] Listing creation and detail view (`apps/api/test/listings.e2e-spec.ts`)

### Infrastructure
- [x] Replace `synchronize: true` with explicit TypeORM migration files (`src/migrations/`, `src/data-source.ts`; prod runs migrations automatically, dev keeps sync)
- [x] Vercel deployment config for `apps/web` (`apps/web/vercel.json`)
- [x] AWS deployment config for `apps/api` (`deploy/ecs-task-definition.json` — ECS Fargate task definition template)
- [x] Production `.env` secrets management (all secrets sourced from AWS Secrets Manager via ECS task definition; `.env.example` updated with `FRONTEND_URL`)
- [x] CORS locked down to production domain (controlled via `FRONTEND_URL` env var in `main.ts`; set to production domain on deploy)

## Known Gaps / Open Decisions

| Gap | Detail | Sprint |
|---|---|---|
| Feed scope | `GET /feed` returns all posts, not just followed users | S3 |
| Comments | `commentsCount` exists on `PostEntity` but no entity or endpoints | S3 |
| Listing limits | `SUBSCRIPTION_LIMITS` defined but not enforced in service | S4 |
| S3 uploads | `mediaUrls[]` fields exist but upload flow not built | S5 |
| Payment gateway | Subscription tier upgrades recorded in DB; no payment processor | Post-MVP |
| Other user profiles | `/profile/[id]` for viewing other people not built yet | S3 |
| Test coverage | ✅ 120 passing unit tests across 10 suites under `apps/api/tests/unit/` | — |
